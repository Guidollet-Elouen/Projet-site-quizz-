We made a quizz site using the framework Django. This site allows you to chose the type of questions you want to answer (MCQ, Open Questions, Number Questions and Comparison Questions) and displays a few questions for you to answer. 
Prior to launching the website, download the following libraries : 
gensim, spacy, nltk

In config.py, switch the path "road" to the right one. Same thing for "nlp_road".

To launch the website, one has to :

- Go in the file directory in the terminal :
- run « python manage.py runserver » in the terminal 
- Copy paste the given URL in a browser
- Answer the questions !
